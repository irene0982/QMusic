    Imagine a cat and a radioactive atom placed in a sealed box. The atom may decay and release poison that kills the cat. We don't know whether the cat is alive or dead until we open the box.
    Before observation, quantum mechanics says that the cat exists in a combination of both outcomes. It's alive and dead at the same time (?!), in a certain proportion. Physicists say that the cat is in a **superposition** state.
    This thought experiment is known as Schr√∂dinger's cat, which is used to illustrate how weird quantum theory is.

    Each type of elementary particle possesses a unique property called **spin**. Just for clarification, nothing is spinning here. 
    Spin is just a property that determines how many possible states a particle can have.
    In our simulation, each particle has two spin states: spin-up and spin-down (Think of them like heads and tails on a coin). 
    According to quantum mechanics, a particle does not have to be just spin-up or spin-down but can exist in a combination of both states.

Here $\vec{B} (\vec{r},t)$ takes the form of $B_0+\nabla B\cdot\vec{r}+F(t)$, pointing in the $z$-direction. $B_0$ is a constant term, and the value is configurable. $F(t)$ is a periodic function that shows how the magnetic field changes with time. You can choose the waveform of $F(t)$. $\nabla B$ determines how the magnetic field changes in location")

st.markdown('''You've probably heard the buzzword *quantum computing*, which is an emerging field that applies quantum mechanics to computation.  In classical computing, we use bits to encode information. A bit is either 0 or 1. Wait, does that ring a bell? Classically, a cat is either alive or dead, but not both. In quantum mechanics, a cat can exist in a combination of both states. That's the idea of quantum computing: we use **qubits**, which are superpositions of 0 and 1, to encode information.

        To be honest, I don't think practical quantum computers are achievable anytime soon because of the physical challenges. But the idea of *quantum music*, which is an area that explores the connection between quantum computing and sound, caught my attention instantly. I'm not insane. In 1956, Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson used the ILLIAC I (Illinois Automatic Computer) to compose the first algorithmic music. Today producers often use computers to write songs, but back then that idea sounded like science fictions. Some crazy ideas *do* eventually work out. Therefore, I spent a year working on quantum music. This web app is one small product.

**Disclaimer:** some crazy ideas *don't* work out.  
I can't predict the future, and I don't want to make fake promises like some quantum computing business people. Quantum computers may or may not be realized. Quantum computers may or may not be used to make music. Still, I think the project is worthing doing. I learned to think creatively and to communicate across fields. Not every attempt needs to succeed, and that's the spirit of research.
(And yes, this app can totally be used for education, despite not being my original goal.)
